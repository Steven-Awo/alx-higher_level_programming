How to use print_square.py

This module defines a function called print_square()

Usage

To print a square, simply call the print_square() function with the desired size as the argument. For example, to print a square with a side length of 5, you would call the function as follows:

python
print_square(5)


This would print the following output to the console:

"
#####
#####
#####
#####
#####
Invalid sizes

The print_square() function only accepts integers as the size argument. If a non-integer value is passed to the function, a TypeError exception will be raised. Additionally, the size argument cannot be less than zero. If a negative value is passed to the function, a ValueError exception will be raised.

Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the print_square() function:

Python
# Print a square with a side length of 1.
print_square(1)

# Print a square with a side length of 4.
print_square(4)

# Print a square with a side length of 10.
print_square(10)

# Print nothing.
print_square(0)

Error handling

If the print_square() function is called with an invalid argument, it will raise an exception. The following table shows the types of exceptions that can be raised by the function:

Exception	Cause
TypeError	The size argument is not an integer.
ValueError	The size argument is less than zero.
You can handle these exceptions in your code by using a try/except block. For example, the following code will print a message to the console if the print_square() function raises an exception:

Python
try:
  print_square(5)
except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
  print(e)
